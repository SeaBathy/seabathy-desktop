# SeaBathy data attribution

SeaBathy does not own or claim ownership of bathymetry, contour, chart, or map datasets.

Any MBTiles or GeoTIFF files uploaded or distributed with SeaBathy must come from sources that allow redistribution.

## Australian bathymetry and contour data

Australian bathymetry and contour MBTiles should only be uploaded if they are derived from open datasets such as Geoscience Australia / AusBathyTopo or another dataset with redistribution rights.

Suggested attribution:

- Source: Geoscience Australia / AusBathyTopo / relevant source dataset
- Licence: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), if applicable
- Processing: converted or derived into MBTiles format for use with SeaBathy
- Changes: tiled, simplified, styled, converted, or processed for offline app use

## Online maps

The maps below are fetched straight from each provider while you look at
them; this project doesn't host or redistribute their tiles. Both apps
(Android and Windows) show each map's credit on screen while it is shown,
on the chart and in the 3D view.

| Map | Credit shown | Provider's terms on offline copies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenFreeMap Dark / Liberty (basemaps; free, no account or key) | OpenFreeMap © OpenMapTiles, © OpenStreetMap contributors | Basemap only: not offered for download |
| OpenStreetMap | © OpenStreetMap contributors | The [tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) bans bulk downloads |
| OpenTopoMap | © OpenStreetMap contributors, SRTM, OpenTopoMap (CC-BY-SA) | Asks for no bulk downloads |
| USGS Imagery | USGS The National Map | Allowed (US public domain) |
| OpenSeaMap seamarks | © OpenSeaMap contributors | Shown online only |
| Sentinel-2 cloudless 2024 (EOX), the built-in offline source (also in 3D) | Sentinel-2 cloudless - https://s2maps.eu by EOX IT Services GmbH (Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data 2024) | Allowed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/): non-commercial use, keep the credit, share packs under the same licence |

Esri's basemaps are not built in, because Esri's terms need an ArcGIS
licence for use in apps. You can still add one yourself with "Add a map link"
if your own Esri terms allow it; the app then shows "Powered by Esri" with it.

The apps' built-in satellite map and offline download source is Sentinel-2
cloudless, whose licence allows both. In the 3D view, "Save this area offline"
is offered for Sentinel-2 and other maps that allow it, but not for Esri,
OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap, whose terms don't allow offline copies: those
can be looked at online only. For a map or link you add yourself, the
offline downloader will download from whatever you choose:
**the choice is yours, and so is checking whether a provider's terms allow it**.
SeaBathy is a tool: what you download with it, and from where, is up to you. The
table above says what the listed providers' terms say. The phone's 3D view keeps
online tiles only for as long as each server's own cache headers allow.

You are responsible for following each provider's terms, including limits
on request volume, offline copies and commercial use. The same applies to
any custom tile link or download source you add yourself.

## Tides and place names

| Data | Source | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tide heights | Open-Meteo Marine API (`sea_level_height_msl`), with E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information. The apps fit tide harmonics to this data to work offline | CC BY 4.0; free for non-commercial use |
| Place search | Open-Meteo Geocoding API (GeoNames data) | CC BY 4.0 |
| Place name at a point | OpenStreetMap Nominatim | ODbL; © OpenStreetMap contributors, credited beside the suggested name; only when you name a spot, one request at a time, per the [usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) |

Tides are modelled, not an official tide table. The apps say so where they show them.

## Sea conditions

Sea conditions are downloaded from these free services and saved on the
phone or PC only. SeaBathy shows their credit on the map while they're shown.

| Data | Source | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Currents, waves, swell, sea temperature forecast | Open-Meteo Marine API, with E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (Météo-France SMOC and MFWAM), ECMWF, DWD and NOAA models | CC BY 4.0; free for non-commercial use. Credited on the map while shown |
| Wind and gusts | Open-Meteo Forecast API (ECMWF, NOAA GFS and other national models) | CC BY 4.0; free for non-commercial use |
| Satellite sea temperature | NASA JPL MUR SST v4.1, via NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP; backup NOAA Geo-polar Blended (GHRSST) | Free and open; credit the source |
| Satellite chlorophyll | NOAA-20 VIIRS daily, via NOAA CoastWatch; backup Copernicus Sentinel-3A OLCI | Free to use and redistribute. Sentinel data must carry "Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data" |
| Sea level anomaly | NOAA CoastWatch blended altimetry (Sentinel-3, CryoSat-2, Jason, SARAL), generated using AVISO+ products | Free to use and redistribute with this credit: "Data courtesy of NOAA; Sentinel data courtesy of Copernicus Program; Generated using AVISO+ products" |
| Salinity | NOAA CoastWatch SMAP, then SMOS, daily | Free to use and redistribute |
| Temperature at depth | HYCOM Consortium (ESPC-D-V02 ocean model) | Public release; demonstration product with no guarantee of availability |
| Latest true colour | NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), VIIRS | NASA data, no restriction on use; credit requested |
| Seabed depths | GMRT, Global Multi-Resolution Topography (Ryan et al. 2009, doi:10.1029/2008GC002332) | CC BY 4.0; not to be used for navigation |

The forecasts come from models about 8 km apart. Near the shore, round
headlands and in narrow channels the real current can be very different.

## Not for navigation

SeaBathy and any supplied map data are for research, planning, educational, and situational-awareness use only.

They are not official nautical charts.

Do not use SeaBathy or supplied map data as the sole source for navigation, vessel operation, anchoring, route planning, or safety-of-life decisions.

Use official hydrographic charts, local notices to mariners, and appropriate navigation equipment.

## Upload rule

Do not upload MBTiles or GeoTIFF files derived from:

- Navionics
- C-MAP
- Garmin charts
- paid chart apps
- scraped commercial map tiles
- restricted hydrographic products
- any source where redistribution is not clearly allowed
